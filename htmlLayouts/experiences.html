            <p>The National STEM Honor Society is a startup in 
                Massachusetts that looks to open chapters in 
                schools nationwide at any level to promote the 
                learning of STEM in communities that don't have 
                the resources to fund STEM education.
            <br><br>
                I joined NSTEM during my first year at community
                college (2020-2021) and soon climbed the ranks
                to Director of the Media Department. As Director,
                I worked with a team of diverse interns in planning
                and executing the creation of different forms of media
                for both internal and external use by the company.
                My biggest accomplishment as Director was starting the
                "Intern Experience Campaign," an idea I had to help the
                receival of the company's internship program by potential
                students.
            <br><br>
                On the Web side, I helped create site content through Wordpress
                for the company's website, as well as developed a Google
                API script to help display the various chapters the company
                had opened nationwide to clients. My biggest accomplishment on
                Web was the Internal Intern Portal, another idea I had to help
                assist Directors and NSTEM's departments on the management of
                intern hours and tasks, which I had cooperated with some other
                directors on to put systems in place.

            <p> During my second year at community college (2021-2022), I joined
                the Tech Student Government Branch of Ohlone's ASOC, R&D. As a 
                Student Coordinator, I was assigned mainly to assist the Hackathon
                team in planning for Ohlone Hackathon 3.0, an in-person event to showcase
                the abilities of Ohlone's STEM community.
                <br><br>
                I helped planned different necessities for the event, such as planning
                merch, food, security, and rooming. During the event I led my own workshop
                where I presented for my club Dot-Slash CS (see below!) and I had a blast
                meeting a lot of fellow STEM students at the college.

            <p> I was a member of Dot-Slash Computer Science for two years
                and served as a president for my second year. A majority
                of my time at Dot-Slash was dedicated to the development
                of my brainchild, MakeMyFuture. MakeMyFuture was an idea I
                had in response to the multiple students I had met during
                my time at Ohlone who had trouble with deciding the most efficient
                schedule plan that they should undertake to optimize their chances
                at transferring to their dream colleges. There were some more unfortunate
                cases of students being completely unaware of necessary requirements for
                the majors they were following; those cases ended with the students
                having to take extra years of courses, a decision which could have
                been completely prevented.
            <br><br>
                I talk more about MakeMyFuture in the Projects section, its development,
                and where you can find the site. MakeMyFuture is definitely the first
                "official" project that I was proud to have finished, and its something
                that motivates me to develop more solutions to problems that my peers
                and I encounter in the world.

            <p> Progressive Kids is a company that holds classes that teach
                young kids about STEM. Classes range from a variety of topics,
                most of which include curriculum on a specific programming language.
                As a tutor, I swapped between multiple sessions and languages,
                allowing me to brush off my skills in Java, Python, Javascript,
                C++, Unity 2D/3D Game Engine (that was a new one), and Scratch.
