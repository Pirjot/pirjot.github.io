    <p>I'm Pirjot, a junior Computer Science major at UCLA! I grew up in the Bay Area, fascinated by the power of computers from an early age. I have a strong love for creative projects that present something unique to catch the attention of users. I'm always looking forward to the next chance to work in a talented team so if you're looking for someone who has the passion and skill to work on a full-scale application, you found the right guy! You can contact me by email at apirjot@gmail.com!</p>

    <p>As for this virtual portfolio, I've had the idea of starting a portfolio to showcase my growing progress on the various projects that I was doing for quite some time. After being drawn to working on projects that simulate a "desktop environment" (I've always loved seeing video games that do this such as the flash game Mu Complex, Simulacra, and a project I worked on with a friend of mine called Crime Lord) I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be cool if, when making my online portfolio, I did something unique and tried a "desktop-style" portfolio?" And so here we are now! I built LaviOS on the p5js canvas framework (a port for Java Processing, in Javascript) and named it after my nickname, Lavender,  or Lavi for short. This is only the start of the portfolio (as of writing this in July 2022) and I'm looking forward to adding a lot more and possibly using this framework for another project. Feel free to explore!</p>
