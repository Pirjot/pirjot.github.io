            <p> <a href="https://auxbattle.herokuapp.com/">AuxBattle</a> is my most recent project that I built with a couple of friends!
                Its an online replica of the popular game of the same name,
                which involves players going head to head in a bracket
                competition to find out who has the better music taste.
                It's right now in its beta version, but I'm looking to see
                if I can finalize it into a more official app that can 
                possibly go on mobile devices.

            <p> <a href="https://makemyfuture.herokuapp.com/">MakeMyFuture</a> is a project that
                I completed while serving as the president of Dot-Slash Computer Science at Ohlone.
                When beginning the planning for the project, I had the idea to also include other STEM
                clubs on the development of the project so over the course of a few weeks, I presented 
                the project to different clubs at Ohlone, including IEEE STEAM, Girls Who Code, Web Dev Club,
                and AI Club. 
                <br><br>
                For two months, I led online classes to instruct my peers on the necessary background needed
                for web development, and over the course of a year I managed a team of builders to see
                the website finished. During Ohlone Hackathon 3.0, I showed off the website to Ohlone students
                to gain a starting audience for future years. Overall, I was very happy with the devleopment of
                the project.

            <p> <a href="https://mimirnet.herokuapp.com/">MimirNet</a> is my first official venture
                into the world of Artificial Intelligence. I've always been interested in 
                new and upcoming AI and their employment in solving interesting problems. MimirNet
                is my first attempt at creating an Artificial Intelligence Engine. I didn't want
                to immediately jump into using AI libraries which are prebuilt (Tensorflow and the like)
                since I think starting from scratch can provide a better insight on using the abstracted
                version of the program. Thus, MimirNet is a simple dense layered forward propagating
                Neural Network using a sigmoid and mean squared error algorithm for optimization. Currently
                I'm in the process of building a project that uses the Tensorflow library, and hopefully
                you'll see that here!

                trick I used to solve the issue of fetching Google Sheets data to someone who wasn't 
                signed into an account that can access it. This was used to display the location
                data on a LeafletJS map for the various schools that NSTEM (the company I was interning at)
                was affiliated with.
